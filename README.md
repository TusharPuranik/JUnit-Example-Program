- A simple project to test and understand how JUnit works and how it can be used to write unit tests. The tests written are used to demonstrate **Assert Functions** such as assertEquals(), assertTrue(), assertFalse(), and many more.
- The unit test code also contains annotations such as @BeforeEach, @AfterEach, and many more.
